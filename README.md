# NF1708

This project includes ROV image annotation from NOAA Ship Nancy Foster's August 2017 expedition in the Gulf of Mexico.

There were 20 different taxa identified from more than 6,000 original images.

This data will eventually be used in creating 100 m transects which will be the replicates in a nMDS analysis.  We hope to identify significant differences in coral community based on geomorphology of the seafloor.
